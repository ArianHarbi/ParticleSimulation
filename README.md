This is a not so realistic simulation of particles in a vacuum.<br>
keybinds : <br>
G -> turn gravity on or off<br>
F -> turn the horizontal electrical field on or off<br> 
C -> change the direction of the horizontal electrical field<br>
V -> turn the vertical electrical field on or off<br> 
U -> change the direction of the vertical electrical field<br> 
M -> turn the magnetic field on or off<br> 
B -> change the direction of the magnetic field<br> 
ARROW KEYS -> move the magnetic field<br> 
WASD -> move the electrical fields(H -> to change which field to move)<br> 
P,E,N -> to choose the particle(protons , electrons or neutrons)<br> 
Mouse Right click -> spawn particles<br> 
R -> reset everything<br>
