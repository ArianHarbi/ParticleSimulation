This is a not so realistic simulation of particles in a vacuum.<br>
keybinds/ 
G -> turn gravity on or off/ 
F -> turn the horizontal electrical field on or off/ 
C -> change the direction of the horizontal electrical field/ 
V -> turn the vertical electrical field on or off/ 
U -> change the direction of the vertical electrical field/ 
M -> turn the magnetic field on or off/ 
B -> change the direction of the magnetic field/ 
ARROW KEYS -> move the magnetic field/ 
WASD -> move the electrical fields(H -> to change which field to move)/ 
P,E,N -> to choose the particle(protons , electrons or neutrons)/ 
Mouse Right click -> spawn particles/ 
R -> reset everything/
