This is a not so realistic simulation of particles in a vacuum.<br>
keybinds : <br>
&nbspG -> turn gravity on or off<br>
&nbspGF -> turn the horizontal electrical field on or off<br> 
&nbspGC -> change the direction of the horizontal electrical field<br>
&nbspGV -> turn the vertical electrical field on or off<br> 
&nbspGU -> change the direction of the vertical electrical field<br> 
&nbspGM -> turn the magnetic field on or off<br> 
&nbspGB -> change the direction of the magnetic field<br> 
&nbspGARROW KEYS -> move the magnetic field<br> 
&nbspGWASD -> move the electrical fields(H -> to change which field to move)<br> 
&nbspGP,E,N -> to choose the particle(protons , electrons or neutrons)<br> 
&nbspGMouse Right click -> spawn particles<br> 
&nbspGR -> reset everything<br>
